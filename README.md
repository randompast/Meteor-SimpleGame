Meteor-SimpleGame
=================

###Description
This is an adaptation from leaderboard application (meteor create --example leaderboard) and the [meteortips tutorial.](http://meteortips.com/book/)  Hopefully, this will help people get started who wish to create a browser based game in meteor.  This project currently shows a black square that moves on a canvas via arrow keys.  Some minor security precautions have been taken using "meteor add accounts-password" and removing "meteor remove autopublish insecure".
